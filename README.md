# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


## Notes

### Contact form

I've managed to get the contact form to email the site owner when a customer makes an enquiry. I've used a web based service called **Formsubmit**. This is a free service however it may have limitations:

* limited number of uses, either per month or in total.
* Limited time to test the service.
