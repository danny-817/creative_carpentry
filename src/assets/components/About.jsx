          Welcome to Creative Carpentry, a small woodworking business based in
          Saddleworth and providing out services to the surrounding areas.
        </p>
        <p>
          Creative Carpentry began at the start of the lockdown for Covid-19 and
          what started as a way to make things for my children has turned into a
          full-time business.

          The first items were simple designs for my children in the garden. Via
          family, friends and neighbours, I started getting requests from people
          to make them versions of the same thing. Jump forward to today and I
          have completed many projects for clients, some standard designs
          however most of my work is customised to your exact requirments.

        Making anything from wood is something I enjoy, and after seeing the
        feedback I received on some of the pieces created during the COVID
        lockdown, I created Creative Carpentry of Saddleworth so I can share my
        skills and passion, with you.
